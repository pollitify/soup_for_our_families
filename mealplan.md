# The Meal Plan

In order to make this easy for both experienced and novice cooks, we have opted to use pre made soup mixes.  Similar to a boxed cake mix, a soup mix requires just a few ingredients (sometimes only water) and can be cooked in just a few hours in a slow cooker.  

To make sourcing materials easier, we have selected soup mixes from Shore Lunch as these can be provided from the same online retailer we use for wagons and slow cookers -- Menards.

The initial seven drops of soup mixes are:

1. Classic Chicken Noodle
2. Fire Roasted Vegetable
3. Home Style Chili
4. Creamy Wild Rice
5. Cheddar Potato
6. Tortilla
7. Black Bean

Just as a home cook can make a boxed cake mix better with additions, some of these soup mixes need one or more additional ingredients as follows:

1. Classic Chicken Noodle - Rotisserie Chicken or 16 ounces canned chicken, 1 can green vegetables, 1 tsp garlic, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 tsp italian seasonings
2. Fire Roasted Vegetable - 1 can diced tomatoes
3. Home Style Chili - 1 pound ground beef, browned
4. Creamy Wild Rice - Optional: Rotisserie Chicken
5. Cheddar Potato 
6. Tortilla - 1 can diced tomatoes, crushed tortilla chips 
7. Black Bean

## What About a Vegetarian / Vegan Option?

We do not have this at this time -- however you don't have to add meat or poultry to the options above should you feel strongly about this.  It is not that we don't agree with the need for vegetarian / vegan options as much as we are doing this on a shoe string budget and more options is more complexity.  Over time we expect to address this.

## Why Doesn't Pollitify Provide the Add In Ingredients ? 

It is important to realize that what we are offering with Soup For Our Families is **mutual aid** not charity.  We do not want to cause people to be dependent on Pollitify.  We are trying to provide a path forward on food aid rather than an ultimate solution.
